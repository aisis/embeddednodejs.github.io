# Chapter 7: Components for Prototyping

This chapter discusses usage of parts and components in an embedded device. When you connect multiple components, they form a circuit.

## Grove Kit 

If you have a software background, you might lack some solder experience. In this case, Grove kit components and components can help you to start building circuits. 

The idea of the <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Main_Page">Grove kit </a> is explained in the Wiki of Seeedstudio.  First, you need a <a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Base-Shield-V2-p-1378.html?cPath=98_16">Base shield</a> such as for Arduino Uno.

To the base shield, you can plug one or multiple Grove kit components:

<ul> 
    <li><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_System">Grove Kit components</a></li> 
   <li><a href="http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Thumb_Joystick">Thumb Joystick</a></li> 
</ul> 

Note that you find the Grove head for the Arduino Nano here: <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/imrehg/grovehat-for-arduino-nano/">Arduino Nano Grove Headers</a>

## Breakout Boards and Shields 

For Arduino, you will find circuits as breakout boards and shiels such as: <a href="https://rheingoldheavy.com/i2c-and-spi-education-shield-functionality-overview/">I2C Education Shield</a>. With this shield, you get a temperature sensor, a real time clock and other components ready made for experimentation.

## Shops 

There are bunch of websites and shops for sourcing components from the internet.

The main places are places such as [Sparkfun](https://sparkfun.com) or [Adafruit](http://adafruit.com). To search [ebay.com](http://ebay.com) or [alibaba - a sort of chinese ebay - ](https://alibaba.com), the <a href="http://www.mysensors.org/">MySensors components search engine</a> is helpful. Another one is <a href="https://www.controleverything.com/products">ControlEverything</a>.

To build setups with "custom" components, [tindie](tindie.com) can be interesting. For example, you can find the <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/imrehg/grovehat-for-arduino-nano/">Grove Hat for Arduino Nano</a> to build a cheap Arduino based experimenters kit.
