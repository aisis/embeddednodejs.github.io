# Chapter 8: Node.js Libraries for Hardware

## The serialport

The serialport is a popular way to transfer data from one device to another. A good place to start with serial communication with Node.js is the [serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport) library.  The GitHub project can be found at [Node serialport library](https://github.com/voodootikigod/node-serialport)

A good overview about using this library is given in [this blog post](http://thinkingonthinking.com/serial-communication-with-nodejs/)
