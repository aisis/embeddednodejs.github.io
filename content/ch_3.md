# Chapter 3: Espruino

The Espruino project enables JavaScript for embedded development on multiple levels.


## Espruino

On the hardware side, the [Espruino Pico](http://www.espruino.com/Pico) is an ineresting board to buy. You can follow the [Quick Start](http://www.espruino.com/Quick+Start) instructions for a first feeling.
The Espruino web page also has nice collection of [Tutorials](http://www.espruino.com/Tutorials).

## Connecting to an Espruino

Besides a command-line application and web IDE, you can connect to an Espruino with a serial interface. For this, download the terminal program [screen (MacOS/Linux)](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/). 

## Robots with Espruino

Gordon has built [some robots based on Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/RobotPCB). The parts for this robot incl. the board are around Â£20. Ask [Gordon](http://espruino.com) for more information.

For this robot, here is a 100% DIY version:

The Espruino does not support the computing power for image processing currently. But it is is possible to hook a [super hacky low res camera to an Espruino](http://www.espruino.com/ADNS5050)
