# Chapter 4: Tessel 2

[The Tessel 2](http://tessel.io/) combines a system-on-chip with embedded Linux and a microcontroller to build IoT prototypes and products.

## Tessel 2

One core feature of the Tessel 2, is its [command line interface](https://tessel.io/docs/cli) based on Node.js.

The Tessel 2 is based on a system-on-chip [Mips 24K], see the datasheet for more details.

With a Tessel 2, you can follow the [Tessel 2 Start Experience](http://tessel.io/t2-start). 

You can find the [Tessel 2 Documentation](http://tessel.io/docs) here.

The main code repository is located at [Tessel Project Main Repo](https://github.com/tessel/project).

## Tessel modules

Some examples of Tessel modules are: 

* [Servo module](https://tessel.io/modules#module-servo)
* [Relay module](https://github.com/tessel/relay-mono)

You can easily design your own [Tessel module](https://github.com/embeddednodejs/tessellib) with help of a CAD program like [Eagle](https://cadsoft.io/de/).

Once designed, you can order and share the board on sites like [oshpark.com](https://oshpark.com).
