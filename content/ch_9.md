#  Chapter 9: Exploring Network Protocols

Protocols are important to work with devices in a network. To understand the physical layer of network systems, a good start are the [Ethernet](http://ethernethistory.typepad.com/papers/EthernetSpec.pdf) and [Wifi specs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.11)

# HTTP

Some important documents to study network protocols are the [HTTP 1.1 spec](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616). It will take a while still until HTTP 2.0 becomes main stream, but a good start is [FAQ HTTP 2.0](https://http2.github.io/faq/).

For developing against an API it can be useful to start with [dummy data](http://embeddednodejs.com/dummy_data.json) first.

In Node.js, there are many web servers and you can find [overview about Node.js Web Servers](http://noeticforce.com/best-nodejs-frameworks-for-web-and-app-development) here.

# The WebSockets protocol (RFC6455)


Enabling real time communication, there is the [webSockets](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455) protocol.
To work with Websockets in Node.js, you can look at the [Websocket stream](https://github.com/maxogden/websocket-stream) module.

A nice overview is also the [Slides by @theturle32 on WebSockets](http://www.scribd.com/doc/60898569/WebSockets-The-Real-Time-Web-Delivered)

WebSockets can also help to enable [RPC over web sockets](https://andreypopp.com/posts/2013-05-21-rpc-over-websocket-the-easy-way.html).
